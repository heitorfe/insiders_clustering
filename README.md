# Insiders Clustering
!imagem
# 1. Context

This project is based in a Kaggle Challenge wich simulates a business problem. An Ecommerce called All in One wants to release the "Insiders Program". This program consists in segment customers based in their features. The main features we are looking into are:
* Gross Revenue (Unit price * Quantity)
* Recency (days since the last purchase)
* Frequency (times the customer purchase in a period)
The most valuable clients will get some benefits, for that, clustering is a good call.

## 3.3. Feature Engineering

Using normalization, rescaling and encoding to prepare the data to the Machine Learning model.

## 3.4. Data Preparation

Using the Extra Trees Classifier to select the most important features to get the best Machine Learning performance.

## 3.5.  Exploratory Data Analysis 
Training different Machine Learning models and comparing errors. The choosen method was the XGBoost Regressor because of the good speed and accuracy of the model.

# Insiders Clustering
!imagem
# 1. Context

This project is based in a Kaggle Challenge wich simulates a business problem. An Ecommerce called All in One wants to release the "Insiders Program". This program consists in segment customers based in their features. The main features we are looking into are:
* Gross Revenue (Unit price * Quantity)
* Recency (days since the last purchase)
* Frequency (times the customer purchase in a period)
The most valuable clients will get some benefits, for that, clustering is a good call.

# 2. Challenge

## 2.1. Problem

The business team wants to retain good customers giving benefits and gifts.

## 2.2. Causes

-There are no method of customer segmentation running.
-Marketing is not data driven.
-The ecommerce don't know their best customers.

## 2.3. Solution

-Using Machine Learning model to do clustering
-Use clusters to do specific marketing to each group of customers

# 3. Solution Development

## 3.1. Data Description 

Checking the shape of the datase, nulls and filling the nulls values.

## 3.2. Data Filtering

Investigating the data and cleaning based on the business assumptions. 

## 3.3. Feature Engineering


## 3.4. Data Preparation

Using normalization, rescaling and encoding to prepare the data to the Machine Learning model.

## 3.5.  Exploratory Data Analysis 

Investigating variancy, outliers and distribution of the features.

## 3.6. Feature Selection

Selecting the most important features to train the model.

## 3.7. Machine Learning Model

Training different Machine Learning models and comparing based on the Silhouette Scores. The choosen method was the K-Means because of the good speed and accuracy of the model. 

## 3.8. Data Visualization on Metabase

Loading the data into a Sqlite file and making visualization in a Dashboar in Metabase.
